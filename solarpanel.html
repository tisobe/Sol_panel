<h3> <em> Summary </em> </h3>

<p style='font-size:105%'>
In this memo, we examine the evolution of solar panel temperatures, electric powers, and
fine sensor temperatures with time. The data are subdivided into several solar 
angle intervals so that we can examine whether the solar angle affects the evolution of these
quantities. 
</p>
<p style='font-size:105%'>
The fine sensor temperatures are already operating well above the temperatures that they did 
near launch and we must revise our operational thresholds upwards limit, and a few other 
quantities may exceed their early mission limits in the next few years. There seems no 
strong solar angle dependency among the quantities examined.
</p>

<h3 style='padding-top:15px'>Solar Panel Temperature and Solar Angle</h3>
<p>
To understand whether the temperatures of the solar panels change as time passes, we 
plotted -Y SADA temperature, +Y SADA temperature, -Y solar panel temperature, and +Y solar 
panel temperature against mission time.

The data are divided into a 20 degree intervals of the solar pitch angle starting at 40 degrees 
(minimum pitch is a little greater than 46) to search for any dependencies of these quantities 
on the solar angle, and then each data group is plotted against the time in years. The _blank 
spaces in the plotted data are due to missing data in MTA database.
</p>


<p>
<a href='#fig1'>Figure 1</a> shows the plots of the data of the angle between 80 and 100.
The red lines indicate top and bottom envelopes, and an average of the data. 
For SADA data, all lines are estimated by a 4th degree polynomial fits to  a 10 day moving box.
The top envelope is the polynomial fits for the maximum values of each 10 day period, the bottom
envelope is that of the minimum, and the middle line is that of the average.
</p>
<p>
For the solar arrays, a model of a linear fit plus sine function plus an exponential decay is used to estimate 
the average fit. The envelopes are set to 4 sigma away from the center line. The sine wave is 
induce by direct solar heating which is maximal in January when the Earth is closest to 
the Sun.
</p>


<p style="padding-bottom:20px">
The green lines indicate the upper and lower limits of the MTA safe operation range.

<p>
The lower envelopes of both + and - Y solar arrays are crossing the lower operation limits,
but the envelopes may be inflated by the outliers (see the next paragraph).
<a href='./plotting_page1.html', target='_blank'>Other solar angle intervals</a>,
appear to stay in the operational ranges in foreseeable future.
</p>

<p>
Note that the solar panel temperature drops to 304K semi-regularly every 6 months or so
(some cases 3 months, and in other cases, 1 year) for a very short time (up to 2 hrs).
This occurs during the Earth eclipse seasons when the tempearature is expected to go down.  
One example is plotted on <a href='#fig2'>Figure 2</a>.  The green vertial lines indicate 
the timing of the eclipes.
</p>

<p style='padding-bottom:20px'>
The data with the solar angles 80 to 100 and 100 to 120 shows more 
of these temperature drops than the other periods, and this could be a cause of the inflated 
envelopes.

<h3>Spacecraft Electric Power and Solar Angle</h3>
<p>
Similar plots are made for spacecraft bus current/voltage (ELBI/ELBV), and electric power
(HRMA power/OBA power). The currents is in Amp., voltage is Volts, and the power is in Watts.
<a href='#fig3'>Figure 3</a> shows the plots of these quantities  of the solar angle interval 
between 80 and 100.
As before, the red lines are the envelopes and the averages obtained by the polynomial fits, 
except for ELBV, in which the average is computed by  a linear/sine function combination. Again, 
the fitting was done only for data after year 2003 for ELBV. 
</p>

<p>
The green lines indicate the  operational ranges, but for HRMA and OBA power, the operational 
ranges are far beyond the plotting ranges, and do not show up in these plots.
</p>

<p>
ELBV in all solar angle ranges have downward trends, and it seems that  eventually they will 
cross the lower operational limit. 
<!-- ****  UPDATE this prediction ******
ELBV with the solar angle between 80 and 120 range probably 
will cross the lower operational limit by year 2010.

<h3 style='padding-top:10px'>ELBI and SADA Temperature</h3>

<p style='padding-bottom:10px'>
Spacecraft electric powers are obiviously related to the solar panel efficiency, and hence the 
temperature of the solar panels. 
<a href='#fig4'>Figure 4</a> shows the spacecraft bus current agaist +Y SASA temperature.

<p>
Although the slope of the fit is about -0.3 up to the soloar angle 100,  the slope 
significantly steepened after the solar angle 120 degree.

<h3>Fine Sensor Temperature and Solar Angle</h3>

<p>
Fine sensor temperatures are the other quantities may behave differently with different 
solar angles.

<a href='#fig5'>Figure 5</a> shows the plots for the fine sensor temperature of the solar angle 
interval between 80 and 100. As before, all red lines are computed by the polynomial fits
method and the green lines are the operational ranges.
</p>

</a>
<br />
<img src='./Plots/sensor_angle80.gif' alt ='sensor angle 80deg' style='width:800px;height:450px'>
</div>


<p>
Although there are several temperature measures on the fine sensors, FFS brackets 
(TFSSBKT1/TFSSBKT2) and FSSE temperature (TPC_FSSE) are only measures which show 
a significant upward drift. 
No power related quantities (e.g., AFSSPC1V---FSS power converter voltage) 
show any signs of the drift.
</p>

<p>
The upper envelopes, and, in some cases, the averages of all three measures  are crossing 
the upper operational limits as early as year 2003, and keep rising.
